# PlatformX

Welcome to the PlatformX documentation — a typed, auditable Python library scaffold for regulated ML systems (pharma and life sciences).

This docs site covers installation, basic usage, governance concerns, and pointers for generating API reference.

Goals
- Provide a clear, opinionated foundation for building auditable model training and retrieval workflows.
- Demonstrate how to install, configure, and extend `platformx`.
- Explain the library's safety and audit-first design choices.

Quick links
- Installation: `Installation` section
- Examples: `Getting Started`
- Contribution guide: `Contributing`

Why Use PlatformX?
- **Audit-first design:** structured audit logs and explicit provenance for regulatory review.
- **Safety-focused workflows:** deterministic safety filters and refusal gating built in.
- **Typed and reproducible:** Pydantic schemas and deterministic dataset/fine-tune artifacts.
- **Extensible adapters:** clear adapter interfaces for model backends and secure data sources.
- **Documentation & traceability:** API docs and changelogs to support compliance.
