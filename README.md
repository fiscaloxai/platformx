# PlatformX

PlatformX is a pharmaceutical and life-sciences focused AI platform designed for building accurate, auditable, and safety-conscious applications. It provides foundational packaging, typing, and governance scaffolding for later phases such as controlled fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented workflows, and regulatory-grade model auditing.
